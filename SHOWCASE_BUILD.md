## GitHub Actions Showcase Instructions
### 2.1. Setting up Your Repository for GitHub Actions
- Create a **new private repository** on your GitHub account.
- In your new repository, create a folder named `.github/workflows`.

### 2.2. Using the GitHub Actions Script
- Obtain the GitHub Actions script provided for the `DogDisplayForPython` application.
   - You can choose between a script that runs on a Windows GitHub Actions runner and a Ubuntu GitHub Actions runner, the scripts are located in the [showcase_scripts](/showcase_scripts/) folder of this repository.
- Place this script you chose into the `.github/workflows` folder you just created.
- Commit and push these changes to the `main` branch of your new repository. 
    ```bash
    git add .github/workflows/*
    ```
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions script for DogDisplayForPython showcase"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
- The script is designed to automatically clone the `DogDisplayForPython` repository and perform all necessary build and setup steps.


### 2.3. Observing the Build and Showcase Process
After you have pushed the GitHub Actions script to your repository, the action will trigger automatically. Here's how you can observe the build and showcase process:

- Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
- A list of workflow runs will be displayed. Click on the name of the run you want to inspect.
- You will see the jobs within the workflow; click on the job named build-and-showcase (or the relevant job title) to view the run logs.
- The logs are organized into collapsible sections for each step of the workflow. Click on each step to expand and view its detailed logs and outputs.

By following these steps, you will be able to monitor the progress of each task within the workflow, verify the successful execution of steps, and ensure that the `DogDisplayForPython` application is building and running as expected.

### 2.4. Understanding Workflow Outputs
After triggering the GitHub Actions workflows, you can observe the following steps and their purposes:

<details>
<summary><ins><b>Workflow Steps:</b></ins> Click here to EXPAND/COLLAPSE a description of the GitHub Actions workflow steps!</summary>

1. **Preparing the Project:** Step that checks out the code from the main repository for `DogDisplayForPython`.

2. **Setup Dependencies**: Installs the necessary programs and sets up the dependencies required for the project.

3. **Configure Environment**: Configures the programs and dependencies installed in the previous step.

4. **Server-Side Tests**: Executes server tests and captures the output in a log.

5. **Execute Showcase Run of Server**: Runs the `python main.py` program, which should be part of the project, and performs a series of predefined Python requests to test current server endpoints. Both the program and the Python requests output to log files, which are displayed in the next two steps for verification.

6. **Display Server Response Logs from Showcase Run (Caution: LARGE Log File)**: Outputs from the server responses captured by the Python requests executed for testing. The logs are expected to be quite lengthy, and expanding this section creates a very large scrollable section in your browser.

7. **Display Server Logs from Showcase Run**: Outputs the server logs that were generated during the `python main.py` run.
